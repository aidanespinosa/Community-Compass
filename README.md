## Description

* User Story - As a prospective home buyer or renter, I want to be able to use a single app to tell me everything I might want to know about my new home’s neighborhood.

* Project Description - A Neighborhood Information App
- We will provide information and reviews about neighborhood crime rates from crimegrade.org, include data on schools from greatschools.org/api/, property values from realtor/zillow API, and other things like local attractions or places of interest like parks, museums, recreational areas, etc all within a 10 mile (for example) radius of the address and the user reviews of those places would come from yelp.com/developers.
- It would be practical for millions of people daily as someone somewhere is always looking to buy or rent a new home.
- The user would simply type in an address and then we convert that address into lat/long and run those numbers against the aforementioned APIs, and return that information in a clean and simple to understand layout.
- This app would allow home buyers or renters to have a more informed idea of the area in which they're planning to move.
- We are considering having a free membership which would return the neighborhood crime grade, and perhaps the school zone and school reviews, while offering a “premium” membership that would return all the additional information listed above.

## Usage

Upon searching for a house, the app will return a plethora of information for the user. Information such as the neighborhood's specific crime rating, the school zone the house is in and the ratings of the schools in that district.
